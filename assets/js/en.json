I obtained my first diploma in computer technology in 2012, followed by training in networks and telecommunications. However, to specialize further and pursue my true passion, I made the decision to undertake training in web application development at Interface 3 in Brussels. That's where I was able to delve into the field that truly inspires me: web application creation and development, where I find genuine fulfillment. Through every line of code, I aim to bring ideas to life and build innovative solutions. I specialize more in backend development while also possessing strong frontend skills, particularly in JavaScript, one of my favorite languages. Additionally, I am convinced that I have a remarkable ability to quickly learn programming languages and an innate capacity to rapidly grasp the logic behind each language.",

Initially, it displayed a basic web page in pure HTML. As the user clicked through, they could choose between 2 different styles to apply to the page. Additionally, they had the ability to add CSS animations and save their preferred version of the page (demonstrating the role of PHP and databases in a web project.)
