        "more_description": "My academic journey has always been closely related to computer science. I obtained my first diploma in computer technology in 2012, followed by training in networks and telecommunications. However, to specialize further and pursue my true passion, I made the decision to undertake training in web application development at Interface 3 in Brussels. That's where I was able to delve into the field that truly inspires me: web application creation and development, where I find genuine fulfillment. Through every line of code, I aim to bring ideas to life and build innovative solutions. I specialize more in backend development while also possessing strong frontend skills, particularly in JavaScript, one of my favorite languages. Additionally, I am convinced that I have a remarkable ability to quickly learn programming languages and an innate capacity to rapidly grasp the logic behind each language.",
